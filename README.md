# ReadMe and How to write it 

<!-- Add some Description here  -->
README (as the name suggests: "read me") is the first file one should read when starting a new project. It's a set of useful information about a project, and a kind of manual. A README text file appears in many various places and refers not only to programming. We will focus on a programmer's README, though. 
It is a simple plain text file that contatins the basic information of the files and some guides.
